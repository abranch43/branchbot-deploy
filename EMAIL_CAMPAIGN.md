## Email 1 — Core Intro (to partners, primes, and friendly contacts)

**Subject:** Introducing Branchberg Revenue Command Center — Empire OS Brief enclosed

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share something I've been building that might be relevant for your work—especially if you're tracking revenue across multiple payment providers or managing financial operations for multiple entities.

**Quick context on who I am:**

I'm Antonio Branch, founder of **A+ Enterprise LLC** (SDVOSB, MBE, SDVE certified in Missouri) and **Legacy Unchained Inc**. I've spent the last few years building modern software infrastructure for government contractors and enterprise operators who need production-grade systems without the complexity of traditional enterprise software.

I'm based in Springfield, MO and work with federal agencies, prime contractors, and commercial clients who need secure, compliant, and maintainable tech stacks. My UEI is **LNL3FWZNFMJ8** and CAGE code is **9RGL5** if you're validating for federal work.

**What I built:**

The **Branchberg Revenue Command Center** is a ship-safe repository + real-time dashboard that unifies revenue tracking across Stripe, Gumroad, and offline contracts/purchase orders. It's a FastAPI backend + Streamlit dashboard that you can deploy to Railway in under 2 minutes and have live revenue tracking the same day.

This isn't vaporware or a prototype. It's production code I use for my own businesses (A+ Enterprise LLC and Legacy Unchained Inc) to track revenue across multiple entities and payment sources. Now I'm making it available for others who have the same problem: scattered revenue data and no unified view until month-end.

**Key features:**

• **Ship-safe FastAPI backend** with Stripe/Gumroad webhook handlers (cryptographic signature verification included)
• **Streamlit real-time console** that auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
• **Railway-provisioned PostgreSQL** for persistent storage (managed backups, no babysitting)
• **Manual revenue ingestion** API for offline contracts and POs (government contractors need this)
• **SAFE_MODE flag** and full CI/security patterns (Bandit, CodeQL, pre-commit hooks)
• **Complete documentation** including deployment guide, API docs, and database schema

**Empire OS Brief (attached):**

I've also attached the **Empire OS Brief** which explains my broader vision for modern financial infrastructure for government contractors and enterprise operators. It covers:

• The problem: scattered revenue, blind spots, and month-end surprises
• The solution: unified ledger, real-time insights, and automated alerts
• The approach: ship-safe repositories, Railway deployment, and production-grade security
• The context: SDVOSB/MBE certifications, federal compliance, and modern DevOps

The Brief is a 2-page PDF that gives you the full picture of what I'm building and why it matters for businesses operating in regulated industries or serving federal clients.

**What I'm asking:**

If this sounds relevant for your work (or for a client/partner you know), I'd love to schedule a 15-minute call to walk through the system and show you the live dashboard. I'm also offering early access pricing for the first 20 adopters.

• **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/abranch43/branchbot-deploy
• **Demo Scheduling**: [Calendly link] (15-minute walkthrough)
• **Email**: antonio.branch31@gmail.com

Even if this isn't a fit right now, I'd appreciate you keeping me in mind for future technical partnerships or subcontracting opportunities. I'm actively pursuing federal contracts (especially DHS, DOD, and civilian agencies) and looking for primes who need reliable technical partners.

Thanks for your time, and I hope the Empire OS Brief gives you a sense of how I'm thinking about modern infrastructure for government contractors.

Best,
**Antonio Branch**

P.S. If you're not interested in the Branchberg Revenue Command Center but know someone who might be (fractional CFO, finance ops consultant, SaaS founder), I'd appreciate the introduction. Happy to comp them early access as a thank-you for the referral.

## Email 2 — Variant for Partners & Primes (Emphasizing Federal Context)

**Subject:** Revenue tracking for multi-entity contractors — Empire OS Brief enclosed

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because I know you work with government contractors who manage revenue across multiple entities, payment providers, and contract vehicles. I've built something that might help.

**Who I am:**

Antonio Branch, founder of **A+ Enterprise LLC** (SDVOSB, MBE, SDVE certified in Missouri). I build production-grade software infrastructure for federal contractors who need modern tech stacks without compromising on security or compliance.

UEI: **LNL3FWZNFMJ8** | CAGE: **9RGL5** | Based in Springfield, MO

**What I built:**

The **Branchberg Revenue Command Center** — a unified revenue ledger that tracks Stripe, Gumroad, and offline contracts in real-time. It's designed for businesses like mine that operate multiple entities (A+ Enterprise LLC, Legacy Unchained Inc) and need a single source of truth for financial operations.

This is production code, not a prototype. Deploys to Railway in 2 minutes, includes full security scanning (Bandit + CodeQL), and has built-in SAFE_MODE for production environments.

**Why it matters for federal contractors:**

• **Multi-entity tracking**: Separate A+ Enterprise LLC revenue from Legacy Unchained Inc revenue, but view totals in one dashboard
• **Offline contract ingestion**: Handle POs and manual contract entries (not everything is a Stripe payment)
• **Audit trail**: Every transaction logged with timestamp, source, and metadata (helpful for DCAA audits)
• **Ship-safe by default**: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, and security scanning built in (matches what federal agencies expect)

**Empire OS Brief (attached):**

The attached 2-page PDF explains my broader vision for financial infrastructure for government contractors. It's not just about this one product—it's about building an ecosystem of tools that help SDVOSB/MBE firms compete with larger integrators on technical capability.

**Next steps:**

If this sounds relevant, let's schedule a 15-minute call. I can show you the live dashboard and walk through the deployment process. I'm also offering early access pricing for federal contractors and their partners.

• **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/abranch43/branchbot-deploy
• **Demo Scheduling**: [Calendly link]
• **Email**: antonio.branch31@gmail.com

Even if this isn't a fit for your current needs, I'd appreciate being kept in mind for future subcontracting or technical partnership opportunities. I'm actively pursuing federal contracts and looking for primes who value reliable technical execution.

Thanks for your time.

Best,
**Antonio Branch**

## Email 3 — Follow-Up (for non-openers after 1 week)

**Subject:** Re: Empire OS Brief — quick follow-up

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on the email I sent last week about the Branchberg Revenue Command Center and the Empire OS Brief. I know inboxes get busy, so I'm resending in case it got buried.

**TL;DR:**

• I built a production-ready revenue tracking system (FastAPI + Streamlit + PostgreSQL)
• It unifies Stripe, Gumroad, and offline contracts in one dashboard
• Designed for government contractors and multi-entity businesses
• Deploys to Railway in 2 minutes, includes full security/CI
• Empire OS Brief (attached) explains the broader vision

If this sounds relevant, I'd love to schedule a quick 15-minute demo. If not, no worries—just wanted to make sure you saw it.

• **GitHub**: https://github.com/abranch43/branchbot-deploy
• **Demo**: [Calendly link]

## Email 4 — Case Study Email (Week 2)

**Subject:** How we tracked $50K across 3 revenue sources in real-time

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick case study from my own businesses:

**The problem:**

I run two entities—A+ Enterprise LLC (SDVOSB) and Legacy Unchained Inc. Revenue comes from:
• Stripe (subscriptions and one-time payments)
• Gumroad (digital product sales)
• Offline contracts (government POs, manual invoices)

Before I built the Branchberg Revenue Command Center, I had no idea what my daily revenue was until I manually reconciled everything at month-end. I was flying blind.

**The solution:**

I deployed the Revenue Command Center to Railway (took 2 minutes). Set up webhooks for Stripe and Gumroad (5 minutes). Added a manual entry API for offline contracts (already built in).

Now I have a Streamlit dashboard that shows:
• Today's revenue: $1,240
• This week's revenue: $6,890
• All-time revenue: $52,340

It auto-refreshes every 10 seconds. I can see every transaction the moment it lands. No more blind spots.

**The impact:**

• **Faster decisions**: I know if a marketing campaign is working *today*, not next month
• **Cleaner bookkeeping**: Everything is already in a database with timestamps and metadata
• **Better cash flow**: I can see when money is actually hitting my accounts (not just when invoices are sent)

**What's included in the repo:**

• Complete FastAPI backend (webhooks, manual entry, health checks)
• Streamlit dashboard (auto-refresh, totals, event feed)
• PostgreSQL schema (revenue_events, revenue_summaries, revenue_alerts)
• Deployment guide (Railway one-click deploy)
• Security patterns (signature verification, input validation, SAFE_MODE)

If you're tracking revenue across multiple sources and want the same visibility, this is the system.

• **GitHub**: https://github.com/abranch43/branchbot-deploy
• **Demo**: [Calendly link] (15 minutes, I'll show you the live dashboard)

Best,
**Antonio Branch**

## Email 5 — Technical Deep-Dive (Week 3)

**Subject:** Architecture of the Branchberg Revenue Command Center

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

If you're still evaluating the Branchberg Revenue Command Center, I wanted to share some technical details about how it's built and why it's production-ready from day one.

**Architecture:**

• **FastAPI Backend**: Handles webhook processing, signature verification, and API endpoints
• **Streamlit Dashboard**: Real-time UI with auto-refresh (no manual reload needed)
• **PostgreSQL**: Three tables (revenue_events, revenue_summaries, revenue_alerts) with optimized indexes
• **Railway Platform**: Automatic provisioning of API, dashboard, and database with managed backups

**Security:**

• Webhook signature verification (Stripe HMAC-SHA256, Gumroad HMAC-SHA256)
• Input validation on all endpoints (prevents SQL injection, XSS)
• Environment variable encryption (Railway handles this at rest)
• HTTPS/SSL enforced by default
• SAFE_MODE flag to disable risky integrations in production

**CI/CD:**

• GitHub Actions for automated testing
• Pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, flake8, mypy)
• Bandit security scanner (finds common vulnerabilities)
• CodeQL for advanced security analysis
• Dependabot for automatic dependency updates

**Why this matters:**

If you're a government contractor or enterprise operator, you can't afford to deploy brittle systems. This repo is designed to be ship-safe from day one—no "we'll fix security later" or "we'll add tests eventually."

It's production-ready code that you can deploy with confidence.

**Next steps:**

If you want to see the architecture in action, let's schedule a 15-minute technical walkthrough. I'll show you the live dashboard, walk through the webhook flow, and answer any questions about deployment or customization.

• **GitHub**: https://github.com/abranch43/branchbot-deploy
• **Demo**: [Calendly link]

Best,
**Antonio Branch**
