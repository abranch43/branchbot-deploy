# PR #7 Description Update

## Required Description:
```
@codex run a code review on this PR. Focus: confirm .gitattributes/.editorconfig correctly enforce UTF-8 and safe EOLs across Windows/macOS/Linux.
```

## Current State Analysis:
- **.editorconfig exists**: ✅ Configured with `charset = utf-8` and `end_of_line = lf`
- **.gitattributes missing**: ❌ No file exists to enforce line endings in Git

## Recommendation for Review:
The code review should verify:
1. **.editorconfig** properly enforces UTF-8 encoding and LF line endings
2. **Missing .gitattributes** file should be created to ensure consistent line endings across platforms
3. Cross-platform compatibility for Windows/macOS/Linux development environments

## Manual Action Required:
Due to authentication limitations in this environment, the PR description must be manually updated to the content specified above.
